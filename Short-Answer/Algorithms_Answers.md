#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) Run time rise in a linear fashion as n increases

b) O(n^2) / The while loop nested within the for loop in range of n exponentially increases the run time as n increases

c) O(n) The recursive call in this instance causes the the run time to rise proportionally to n as it increases

## Exercise II

I feel like the spec of this exercize is too vague to write out more fleshed out pseudo code or maybe I just don't understand what's being asked. Do you start at a specific floor? Are we at the top then moving down? Do you have to throw an egg from every floor? why are we wasting these eggs?

<!-- def tossin_eggs(stories):
     break_point_floor = 0
     current_floor = 0
     egg_break = false
     for story in stories:
         if egg_break = false:
             current_floor += 1
         else:
             break_point_floor = story
             return break_point_floor

    O(n)-->
